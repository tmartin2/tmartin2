### Hey there!

My name is Trevor. I have recently completed my undergraduate studies and received a B.A. in Neuroscience and Mathematics. 
I am currently trying to focus on:
- Reproducing machine learning research 
- Making art: optimization art, collages, three.js stuff, etc...
- Building up my website: trevormartin.info
- Making a dataset of fossils and training YOLOv4 on it
- Increasing my productivity and learning 
- How to reach me: tmartin2@oberlin.edu
- Closing remark: Enjoy your day.
